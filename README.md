## 📘 Overview
This collection of PowerShell scripts automates common IT troubleshooting and diagnostic tasks across Windows environments.  

Each script is focused, efficient, and built to generate exportable logs and reports.  

The toolkit covers:
- Network connectivity testing  
- Disk health and free-space monitoring  
- Windows service verification and restart  
- Event log error scanning  
- User profile and login issue detection  
- Windows Update auditing and compliance reporting  

All scripts were created and tested in **Windows PowerShell ISE** on Windows 11.
